Most health advice is built on averages. A clinical trial might show that a supplement helps 60% of people — but you have no idea if you're in the 60% or the 40%. An **N-of-1 study** flips that model. Instead of studying thousands of people once, you study yourself repeatedly.

## What Exactly Is an N-of-1 Study?

An N-of-1 study (also called a single-subject trial) is a structured experiment where one person — you — systematically tests an intervention on yourself. The "N" in N-of-1 refers to the sample size: one.

Unlike casually trying something and seeing how you feel, an N-of-1 study uses the same rigor as a clinical trial:

- **Defined outcomes** — What are you measuring? Sleep quality via PSQI? Mood via PHQ-9? You pick validated instruments so the data means something.
- **Controlled conditions** — You alternate between treatment and control periods, reducing the chance that some random life event is driving your results.
- **Systematic data collection** — You log data at consistent intervals, not just when you remember.
- **Statistical analysis** — With enough data points, you can determine whether a change is real or noise.

## Why Would You Run One?

The honest answer: because averages don't apply to individuals.

Take testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). Studies show it improves energy and mood in hypogonadal men *on average*. But the response varies wildly. Some men feel dramatically better in weeks. Others notice nothing. A few feel worse.

An N-of-1 study lets you answer the only question that matters: **does it work for me?**

Common use cases:

- **Supplements** — Does magnesium actually improve your sleep, or is it placebo?
- **Diet changes** — Does cutting dairy reduce your inflammation markers?
- **Exercise protocols** — Is zone 2 cardio or HIIT better for *your* recovery metrics?
- **Medications** — What's the optimal dose for your symptoms?
- **Sleep interventions** — Does a 10pm cutoff on screens change your deep sleep percentage?

## How Do You Actually Run One?

### Step 1: Define Your Protocol

Pick one intervention and one or two primary outcomes. Keep it simple. "I want to test whether 400mg magnesium glycinate before bed improves my sleep quality over 8 weeks" is a good protocol. "I want to optimize my entire health" is not.

### Step 2: Choose Your Instruments

Use validated measurement tools where possible. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is better than "rate your sleep 1-10" because it's been validated across thousands of studies. Similarly, the PHQ-9 for mood, the IIEF-5 for sexual function, or the SF-36 for general vitality.

### Step 3: Establish a Baseline

Collect data for 1-2 weeks *before* changing anything. This is your control period. Without a baseline, you can't tell if changes are real.

### Step 4: Run the Intervention

Start the intervention and continue logging at the same intervals. Most protocols run 4-12 weeks depending on what you're testing.

### Step 5: Analyze Your Results

Compare your intervention period to your baseline. With enough data points, you can see whether the change is statistically meaningful or just random variation.

## The Power of N-of-Many

Here's where it gets interesting. Your individual study is valuable on its own. But when your data joins hundreds or thousands of others running the same protocol, patterns emerge that no single person could see.

Maybe your TRT response was in the 78th percentile. Maybe people with your baseline testosterone level tend to respond faster. Maybe the supplement that did nothing for you works well for a different demographic.

This is the **N-of-Many** model: individual rigor, collective insight.

## Common Objections

### "Isn't this just biohacking?"

Biohacking is usually unstructured — try something, see how you feel, move on. An N-of-1 study is structured self-experimentation with validated instruments and controlled conditions. The difference is rigor.

### "Can one person's data really be meaningful?"

Yes, if collected properly. N-of-1 trials are recognized by the medical community. The Journal of Clinical Epidemiology has published extensively on their validity. The key is multiple measurements over time within the same person, which controls for between-subject variability.

### "Don't I need a doctor for this?"

For lifestyle interventions (sleep, diet, exercise, supplements), you don't need medical supervision. For medications or hormonal therapies, you should absolutely work with a physician — but the data you collect in an N-of-1 study can make those conversations dramatically more productive.

## Getting Started

The simplest way to run your first N-of-1 study:

1. **Pick one thing** you've been curious about
2. **Choose how to measure it** (preferably with a validated instrument)
3. **Log baseline data** for 1-2 weeks
4. **Start the intervention** and keep logging
5. **Review your results** after the protocol period

Your body is unique. The only way to know what works for you is to test it — rigorously.
